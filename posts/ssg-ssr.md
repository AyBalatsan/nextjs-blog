My skills:
1) Vanilla js (For animation, submitting forms, requests via ajax requests, interacting with the Dom tree, validating forms, I know how to connect third-party libraries, processing arrays and objects, in short, I know the base.)
2) Layout (I use pug/less/sass, I know SEO partially, I use BEM methodology. I managed to get acquainted with bootstrap 5 - I didn’t like it, I think it’s not acceptable for large projects)
3) I can build builds on Gulp, Webpage (I just need to refresh my knowledge a little, as I mainly did builds on gulp)
4) Git upload the project, merge and everything like that.
5) React at the learning level, but I can make a SPA project with components and my own architecture
6) Worked with Figma graphic editor.

I plan to continue learning typeScript.
